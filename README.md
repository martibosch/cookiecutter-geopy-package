# Cookiecutter geopy package

Template for Python packages using GDAL (from conda-forge).

## Features

This project template includes the following features to ensure best practices:

- **Overall project configuration**: [pyproject.toml](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518) for [PEP-626](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626)-compliant project configuration.
- **Tests**:
  - [tox](https://tox.wiki) for testing against multiple Python versions, with support for conda dependencies using [tox-conda](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda) and GitHub Actions using [tox-gh-actions](https://github.com/ymyzk/tox-gh-actions).
  - [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) reporting with [codecov](https://codecov.io) integration.
- **Documentation**: generated with [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org), using [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) for Markdown support, auto API generation from docstrings and hosting on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org) with the [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme).
- **Code quality**: set up with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run checks and tests before each commit, including, among others:
  - [ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs) for Python code linting and formatting
  - [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) to check for common misspellings
  - [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) to automate upgrade syntax for newer Python versions
- **Continuous integration and delivery** with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), with jobs to run tests, publishing to test PyPI and releasing to PyPI and GitHub on new tags.
- **Conventional commits and semantic versioning** with [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen) to enforce [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (with `commit-msg` pre-commit hooks), version bumping using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and automated change log generation.

## Usage

### First time setup

Generate a new project using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter):

```bash
cookiecutter gh:martibosch/cookiecutter-geopy-package
```

and fill in the prompts. Then, navigate to the generated directory and follow the instructions below:

- Initialize a git repository (e.g., `git init`) and install the pre-commit hooks by running `pre-commit install` and `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`.
- Register the project in [codecov](https://codecov.io) and [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org).
- If the repository is public, enable [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) to automatically run pre-commit checks on GitHub and autoupdate the pre-commit hook versions.
- Create accounts (or use existing accounts) and [set up pending publishers for the github repository](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/) for [PyPI](https://pypi.org) and [test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org). Enter "release.yml" in the "Workflow name" field and respectively "pypi" and "testpypi" in the "Environment name" field.

You can then start developing your package.

### Submit a recipe to conda-forge

If you want your package to be available from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org), you can generate a recipe for it using [grayskull](https://github.com/conda/grayskull) and then submit it by following the instructions in the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html#forking-and-pull-request).
